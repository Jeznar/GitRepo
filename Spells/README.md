# Spells
This repository will contain my automated spells as I create new one or update those (there are many) that currently reside only in my game data (which is regularly backed up).

Since there should eventually be a enourmous number of spells in this repo, this document will list the spells and provide a link to the README for each spell level which contain additional notes.
