# 9th Level Spells
This repository will contain my automated 9th level spells as I create new or update existing (there are many) that currently reside only in my game data (which is regularly backed up) I'll add them here.

Spells will have notes on elements that I think are interesting.  In some cases differences from RAW, notes on how to use the spell in game, or coding notes.

## Spell Notes

### Time Stop

This spell manages the duration and monitors for the caster doing damage that results in an early termination.  It also places a **N Action** cub condition on all tokens in the scene other than the caster when started and removes them when completed.
