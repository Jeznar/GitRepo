# 8th Level Spells
This repository will contain my automated 8th level spells as I create new or update existing (there are many) that currently reside only in my game data (which is regularly backed up) I'll add them here.

Spells will have notes on elemnts that I think are interesting.  In some cases differences from RAW, notes on how to use the spell in game, or coding notes.

## Spell Notes

### Place Holder

A non-existant spell, its only purpose is holding a place in my documentaton.
