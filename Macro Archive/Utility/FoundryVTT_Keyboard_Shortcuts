Create macro (script type) with: let journal = game.journal.getName('Exact Name of Journal'); 
or let journal = game.journal.get('JOURNAL_ID');. And then you have two options: 
journal.show('text'); to show text, or journal.show('image'); to show image. 
It's taken from Foundry API. I recommend to look into it for more details, because there 
is also second argument to bypass permissions If journal is empty or there is no image it 
won't show anything (at least at FVTT v0.7.9)

Note: This only works for journal entries "owned" by the player showng them.

let journalName = "FoundryVTT Keyboard Shortcuts"; // Must be exact match
let force = true; // Boolean to override permissions
let page = 'text'; // Show either "text" or "image"
let journal = game.journal.getName(journalName);
journal.show(page, force);
