      "value": "<p>Â </p>\n<p>As a <strong>bonus action</strong>, you can expend a <strong>1st level spell slot</strong> to cause your hair to lengthen, strengthen, and spring to life for <strong>1 minute</strong>.</p>\n<p>While it is animated, you can use your action to make a melee spell attack with a range of 5 feet with it, dealing <strong>1d8 bludgeoning damage</strong> on hit. This increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th Level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>\n<p>If you hit a Large or smaller creature with this attack, as a bonus action you can attempt to <strong>grapple the creature </strong>with your hair using your <strong>Wisdom modifier</strong> in place of your Strength modifier to initiate and maintain grapple.</p>\n<p>A grappled creature can contest the grapple as normal, or deal <strong>5 slashing, fire, or acid damage to the hair </strong>to free themselves. The hair has an <strong>AC of 12</strong>, and you take no damage when it is attacked.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>FoundryVTT</strong>: This is not automated.</p>",
