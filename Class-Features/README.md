# Class Features
Abilities that are (at least mostly) Specific to a Given Class

[Link back to my Repo Listing](https://github.com/Jeznar/GitRepo)

I anticipate a large number of features here, I will try to drop them into specific classes with a table of contents for classes and each class having its own list of features.

## Classes with Features

* [Occultist](#occultist)
* [Warlock](#warlock)

## [Occultist](Occultist/README.md)

This is a home-brew class found online: **[5e - Occultist - Witch, Oracle, Shaman (KibblesTasty)](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M-WtrKeZNFdEXq0MKXw)** by KibblesTasty.

* [Sacrificial Summon](Occultist#sacrificial-summon) (features a warpgate summoning of a minion)
* [Witch's Touch](Occultist#witch-touch)

## [Warlock](Warlock/README.md)

This is the standard [Warlock class](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/warlock).  I will be concerned with Celestial Warlock abilities, because that is what my game is featuring.

* [Healing Light](Warlock#healing-light)
