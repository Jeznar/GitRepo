# Class Features
Abilities that are (at least mostly) Specific to a Given Class

[Link back to my Repo Listing](https://github.com/Jeznar/Jeznar/blob/main/README.md)

I anticipate a large number of features here, I will try to drop them into specific classes with a table of contents for classes and each class having its own list of features.

## Classes with Features

* [Occultist](#occultist)

## [Occultist](Occultist/README.md)

Ths is a home brewclass found online: **[5e - Occultist - Witch, Oracle, Shaman (KibblesTasty)](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-M-WtrKeZNFdEXq0MKXw)** by KibblesTasty.

* Sacrificial Summon (features a warpgate summoning of a minion)
