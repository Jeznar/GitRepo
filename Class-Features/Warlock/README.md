## Feature Notes

### Healing Light

This item implements the RAW ability with VFX **AND** an option to have a HEAL_ITEM (defined in the macro as a constant) that if possessed by the actor and attuned will add the actor's casting modifier to the amount healed.

In my campaign, the additional feature is triggered by the Blood Staff.
