      "value": "<p>%TOKENNAME% usually contains a number of corpses.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>When first encountered, a corpse flower contains the corpses of 1d6 + 3 humanoids. A corpse flower can hold the remains of up to nine dead humanoids. These remains have total cover against attacks and other effects outside the corpse flower. If the corpse flower dies, the corpses within it can be pulled free.</p>\n<p>While it has at least one humanoid corpse in its body, the corpse flower can use a bonus action to do one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The corpse flower digests one humanoid corpse in its body and instantly regains 11 (2d10) hit points. Nothing of the digested body remains. Any equipment on the corpse is expelled from the corpse flower in its space.</li>\n<li>The corpse flower animates one dead humanoid in its body, turning it into a zombie. The zombie appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the corpse flower and acts immediately after it in the initiative order. The zombie acts as an ally of the corpse flower but isn’t under its control, and the flower’s stench clings to it (see the Stench of Death trait).</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>FoundryVTT</strong>: The number of corpses is tracked through a buff on the Corpse Flower token.  If there are none, this item can be used to initialize the stack.  If there are one or more corpses, this item will provide a dialog to allow a choice of hos to use the corpse and will decrment the count.</p>\n</section>",
