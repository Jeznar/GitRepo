## Feats in this Repo

There are a ton of feats, but I've needed very few so far, so I'll keep this as a level deep list (for now, at least).

## Inspiring Leader

This item will add the appropriate temp HP to all **friendly** tokens within range.  It does not enforce the **up to 6 targets** feature of the spell, this is left to the players to handle by arranging tokens on scene correctly.

It always benefits **friendly** tokens regardless of the attitude of the caster.  The underlying assumption is the GM can/should manually deal with temp HP for hostile or neutral creatures.

If the user of this ability doesn't want to include himself, then simply remove the temp HP manually after using this ability.
