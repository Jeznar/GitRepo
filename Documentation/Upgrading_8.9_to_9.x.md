The following is a quote from [Crymic on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/562549978506199042/849048013468598272/968966845833019412), 4/27/21.

~~~
all token updates are now token.document.update()
creation now goes through: token.actor.createEmbeddedDocuments("Type", [array data]);
updates updateEmbeddedDocuments()
deletes deleteEmbeddedDocuments()
You can now pass multiple objects since it's an array. 
rolls new Roll("1d4").evaluate({async: true or false}); if you pick true, you'll need to await the roll. 
there's couple of changes to the canvas as well.
~~~

So, as in almost everything Crymic posts, there is a lot to unpack in those lines.  I need a deeper understanding, the following is my attempt at understanding each element.

## Token updates now token.document.update()

### token.update
My code has more than a few token updates.  Create_Specter.js contains an example:

~~~javascript
tToken.update({ "hidden": true });
~~~

I think the above needs to be updated to read as follows:

~~~javascript
tToken.document.update({ "hidden": true });
~~~

#### Similar issue with token.uuid reference 

I found a similar warning for MidiQOL.socket calls as shown below.  The second line clears it up.

~~~javascript
// Following line seems busted in 9.x
await MidiQOL.socket().executeAsGM("createEffects", { actorUuid: token1.uuid, effects: restrainedEffect });
// The following clears the warning
await MidiQOL.socket().executeAsGM("createEffects", { actorUuid: token1.document.uuid, effects: restrainedEffect });
// This also works and feels more correct, so I will be using this form
await MidiQOL.socket().executeAsGM("createEffects", { actorUuid: token1.actor.uuid, effects: restrainedEffect });
~~~

The first line in the above can fail quietly, no error message, no application of the effect.  

Another concern are lines like:

~~~javascript
MidiQOL.socket().executeAsGM("removeEffects",{actorUuid:pairedToken.actor.uuid, effects: [pairedEffectObj.id] });
~~~

#### Plane_Shift_Self_Only.js Contains two Instances of This

This script contains the following two lines that look to have this issue:

~~~javascript
await aToken.update({ "hidden": false });
aToken.update({ "hidden": true });
~~~

Running the script generates the following console warning:

~~~
You are calling PlaceableObject#update which has been deprecated in favor of Document#update or Scene#updateEmbeddedDocuments. Support will be removed in 0.9.0
~~~

### actor.update
I fiddled with what looks to be a similar call in *Healing_Light.js* that read as:

~~~javascript
await aToken.actor.update(resUpdate);
~~~ 

The above does not generate a warning and it worked on my test 9.x setup, so I am not going to try to *fix* this type of call

### chatmsg.update 
This type of call is not a token, but its similarity makes me wonder if it might be affected.  The following line is pretty common in my scripts for updating a chat card:

~~~javascript
await chatmsg.update({ content: content });
~~~

From observation this is not an issue.

### effect.update

Do the calls to effect.update need to be updated?  There are lots of uses similar to the following:

~~~javascript
const result = await effect.update({ 'flags.dae.specialDuration': effect.data.flags.dae.specialDuration,
                                         'origin': LAST_ARG.itemUuid });                                    
~~~

From observation this is not an issue.

### tokens.updateMany

I have a few instances of using this call, which read similarly to the following:

~~~javascript
canvas.tokens.updateMany(updates);
~~~

The above generates the following warning (and dies in 9.x)

~~~javascript
You are calling PlaceablesLayer#updateMany which has been deprecated in favor Scene#updateEmbeddedDocuments. Support will be removed in 0.9.0
~~~

need to call game.scenes.current.updateEmbeddedDocuments

That seems like another potential area needing its calls changed.

## Creation: createEmbeddedDocuments(...)

The 9.x format for this call looks like the following:

~~~javascript
token.actor.createEmbeddedDocuments("Type", [array data])
~~~

Crymic pointed out: *You can now pass multiple objects since it's an array.* I'll need to fiddle with this to get benefit, I think.

Scanning my code, it seems I have been mostly using the *new* style and should generally be ok on this one.  

Two exceptions, the first being *Tile.create(...)* calls.  This snippet is from *Cloudkill.js*

~~~javascript
let newTile = await Tile.create({
        x: templateCenter.x,
        y: templateCenter.y,
        img: "modules/jb2a_patreon/Library/1st_Level/Fog_Cloud/FogCloud_03_Regular_Green02_800x800.webm",
        width: GRID_SIZE * 8,   // 20 foot across
        height: GRID_SIZE * 8   // 20 foot tall 
    });
~~~

The second being *ChatMessage.create(...)* calls, quite a few of them, but the most often used from within *jez-lib.js*

~~~javascript
await ChatMessage.create({
          speaker: speaker ? ChatMessage.getSpeaker(speaker) : null,
          type: CONST.CHAT_MESSAGE_TYPES.OTHER,
          content: chatCard
      });
~~~

## Update: updateEmbeddedDocuments(...)

I have a fairly large number of calls that look like (this one from Etherealness.js)

~~~javascript
await aToken.update({ "hidden": false });
~~~


## Delete deleteEmbeddedDocuments(...)

Lots of calls to *.delete(...)* that may be affected here.  One example from *Toggle_Flanking_1.0.s*

~~~javascript
await existingEffect.delete();
~~~

## Roll now requires async true/false
Crymic pointed out, rolls needs to specify async:false or be awaited. 

~~~javascript
new Roll("1d4").evaluate({async: true or false}); 
~~~

Lines like the following from *Howling Babble* are going to fail with damageRoll getting an unfulfilled promise, or perhaps other error condition. 

~~~javascript
// The line below will fail
let damageRoll = new Roll(`${DAM_DICE}+${jez.getCastMod(aToken)}`).evaluate();
// Following line is a working version
let damageRoll = new Roll(`${DAM_DICE}+${jez.getCastMod(aToken)}`).evaluate({async:false});
~~~

## Couple of changes to the canvas

I have no idea what these are, so I suppose I will bump into them. 

## Sequencer Updates

In testing I noticed the following warning: 

~~~javascript
Sequencer | Window | reachTowards - This method has been deprecated, please use .stretchTo() instead
~~~

This was generated by *Healing_Light.js* which contained the following line:

~~~javascript
.reachTowards(token1)
~~~

Changing it to this, resolved the warning:

~~~javascript
.stretchTo(token1) // Replacement for .reachTowards
~~~

My GitRepo contains the following problem children for this case:

![reachTowards().png](Upgrading_8.9_to_9.x/reachTowards().png)
 
The above have been fixed.  

## New Method to Roll Damage

This is from [Crymic 4/28/22](https://discord.com/channels/562549978506199042/849048013468598272/969364807423782922)

> If you're rolling damage, should switch to 
> ```new game.dnd5e.dice.DamageRoll("1d4", {},  {critical: true}).evaluate({async:false});```
> 
> It'll automatically roll the correct number of dice.

## .createEmbeddedEntity Throws an Error

[Freeze on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/170995199584108546/699750150674972743/928018172865552434)

> createEmbeddedEntity is deprecated, use createEmbeddedDocuments and put [ ] around effectData
> also lose user: game.user._id (it does nothing), or make it user: game.user.id still doesn't really do anything but at least gives the correct id and not undefined ðŸ™‚ in your chatmessage object

These cases need to be moved to use ```.createEmbeddedDocuments("Type", [array data])```.

## Additional Issues

### ChatMessage.create

Investigate: ```ChatMessage.create``` for ```user:``` which seemingly do nothing.

### ATL 

ATL uses a new format for its flags.  Any script that has settings of the form:

~~~javascript
changes: [
    { key: "ATL.dimLight", mode: UPGRADE, value: 40, priority: 20 },
    { key: "ATL.brightLight", mode: UPGRADE, value: 20, priority: 20 },
    { key: "ATL.lightColor", mode: OVERRIDE, value: color, priority: 30 },
    { key: "ATL.lightAlpha", mode: OVERRIDE, value: 0.25, priority: 20 },
]
~~~

Should be more like this:

~~~javascript
{ key: "ATL.light.dim", mode: UPGRADE, value: 40, priority: 20 },
{ key: "ATL.light.bright", mode: UPGRADE, value: 20, priority: 20 },
{ key: "ATL.light.color", mode: OVERRIDE, value: color, priority: 30 },
{ key: "ATL.light.alpha", mode: OVERRIDE, value: 0.05, priority: 20 },
~~~

Notice the tiny alpha value now used to prevent blowing out the scene.
